î°ƒ// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

read number1
echo -n "Please enter 2nd number: "
read number2 
sum=$(($number1 + $number2))
echo "The sum of the two numbers is $sum."

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

echo "Please enter 5 numbers (separated by a empty space):"
read -r var1 var2 var3 var4 var5
echo "$var1 $var2 $var3 $var4 $var5" > tmp01

awk '{printf "%.14f\n", ($1+$2+$3+$4+$5)/5}' tmp01 > tmp02
echo "The average of the 5 numbers is $(cat tmp02)"

tr -s ' '  '\n'< tmp01 > tmp03
echo "" >> tmp03
sed -i '/^[[:space:]]*$/d' tmp03

sort -g -k 1 tmp03 > tmp04
awk 'END{print $1}' tmp04 > tmp05
echo "The maximum number is $(cat tmp05)"
awk 'NR == 1 {print $1}' tmp04 > tmp06
echo "The minimum number is $(cat tmp06)"

echo "The 5 numbers are:" > tmp07
cat tmp07 tmp01 > output
echo "The average of the 5 numbers is $(cat tmp02)" >> output
echo "The maximum number is $(cat tmp05)" >> output
echo "The minimum number is $(cat tmp06)" >> output
rm -f tmp0*
